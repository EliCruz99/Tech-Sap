## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: 

I have a good understanding of how and what I want my website to do (Thanks to the Wireframe). I should be able to implement what my wireframe showed without any real difficulty. I am comfortable enough to be able to search for help online.

### Weaknesses: 

Being able to use higher-order functions to bring the information from my API to life(render it). CRUD is still a little blury to me but I have the axios documentation I can look at if I do get lost.

### Opportunities:

I will further my understanding of CRUD and higher-order functions so I am comfortable with them. I will also be able to solidify myself in React comfortably this week because I will finally able to put in the pieces of the puzzle that I was given the past 2 weeks

### Threats:

Getting lost or stuck on a issue without asking for help. I can find ways to solve online them but I won't be able to understand why and I can just continue searching for hours on how to get a piece to work. I need to be able to stay to my schedule and at the least ask for help when needed
